| Time to complete | 20 minutes

## Steps

- Building on the previous lab, create a `while` loop that iterates from -40°F to 212°F.
- For each iteration, display the temperatures in Fahrenheit (F), Celsius (C), and Kelvin (K).
- Use correct formulas:
	- `double C = (F - 32.0) * 5.0/9.0;`
	- `double K = C + 273.15;`

### Success criteria
- Output is tabular and readable (e.g., separated by tabs or aligned columns).
- Loop terminates correctly at 212°F.

### Where to find the solution
