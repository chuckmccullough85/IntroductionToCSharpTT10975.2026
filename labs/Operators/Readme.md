## Steps

1. Either create a new console project, or continue with your current project.
2. Declare a variable to hold a Fahrenheit value
3. Declare a variable to hold Celsius
4. Declare a variable to hold Kelvin

Use these formulas (be mindful of parentheses and floating-point division):

- K = C + 273.15
- F = (C * 9.0/5.0) + 32.0
- C = (F - 32.0) * 5.0/9.0

5. Pick a value for F and convert to C and K
6. Pick a different value and repeat
7. Convert several F,C, and K values to the other scales and display.

---

### Success criteria
- Display at least three conversions for each scale (F→C/K, C→F/K, K→F/C).
- Use clear labels and consistent formatting for output.

### Where to find the solution
