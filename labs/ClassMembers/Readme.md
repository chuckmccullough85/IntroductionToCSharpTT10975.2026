## Success Criteria
Your solution should:
- Define `const` member TAX_RATE and use it consistently throughout the class
- Replace all single-line methods with expression-bodied members
- Add DateOfBirth as an auto-property of type DateTime
- Support multiple constructors (with and without DateOfBirth parameter)
- Follow DRY principle by reusing constructor code

## Where to find the solution
See [solutions/ClassMembers](../../solutions/ClassMembers)
## Instructions


1. Define a ```const``` member named TAX_RATE=.0765f;  Replace hard-coded values in the code with the TAX_RATE
1. Replace any 1 line methods with expressions
1. Add an auto property DateOfBirth - type **DateTime**
1. Create another constructor that accepts name, id, salary and dob as parameters.  Stay DRY!
